CURRENT ROADMAP:
----------------
Improve and finalize CppParser APIs. - InProgress.
Remove mutated, const_cast, explicit static_cast to maximum possible.

Add features to cib so that it supports wxWidgets entirely.
Stretch goal: It appears CppParser can be improved to parse entire wxWidgets headers as-is, witout any modification.

=========================================================================

Add a detail page for illustrating cib tool and it's command line option.

Emit __zz_cib_ObjectFromHandle only for classes whose objects are passed as values.

Investigate why we need ~__zz_cib_AbiFunctor()
